# User stories Batch 1

## [ ] As a user I want to be able to download the dataset for EITHER comment generation OR code refinment

## [ ] As a user I want to be able to submit my predictions for the given downloaded dataset

## [ ] As a user I want to be able to see the performance of my predictions against the benchmark (comment generation: bleu score, code refinement: # tests passed)

# Work flow

First I'll do a basic express server to serve the datasets. No login no frontend. I'll implement
Batch 1 then move on to some other features (frontend, maybe auth).

# Batch 2

## [ ] As a dev I want to be able to deploy my webapp into a container

## [ ] As a user I want to have a webpage to make all the actions mentioned above
